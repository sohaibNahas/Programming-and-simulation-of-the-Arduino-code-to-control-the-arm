# Programming-and-simulation-of-the-Arduino-code-to-control-the-arm
This is a two task 
The first is programming a web page to control the arm using the web serial API
second task is a Write the Arduino code for the control
I did extensive research on how to write the Arduino code and I tried many codes and modified them until the code worked for me correctly. I updated the Arduino program and wrote the code and then I moved to the task of controlling the arm and applying it after a long search in Google and YouTube
I used (Tinkercad simulator) To control the arm through the Arduino Uno, there are simulation images and its practical application with different movements
